### Nodemailer Example
An example app that shows how to implement mailing with [Nodemailer](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer). Sends emails with [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), previews them with [nodemailer-stub-transport](https://github.com/andris9/nodemailer-stub-transport).

##### To Run
1. Clone / fork the Repo
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run your local connection of Mongo DB.
1. Run `gulp` to launch on local.

For immediate issues, check the `src/server/config` directory which sets up credentials for SES and the mongo url.
